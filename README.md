# Hours_v-s_Percentage_Score
Welcome to my first project as an intern at The Spade Foundation, where I delve into the world of data science and business analytics! This repository houses my inaugural task, focusing on predicting percentage scores based on hours studied using a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically the linear regression model.

Project Overview: Predict percentage scores based on hours studied using linear regression.

Dataset: Utilized a CSV file with two columns: Hours studied (independent variable) and Percentage score (dependent variable).

Dependencies: Requires Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

Usage: Clone the repository, install dependencies, run the Python script, and interpret the regression line to predict scores based on hours studied.

Results: Achieved a regression model with high accuracy, indicating a strong correlation between hours studied and percentage scores.

Future Work: Implement cross-validation techniques, explore other regression algorithms, and deploy a web application for real-time predictions.
